Spring 2012 : [COP 6726] Database Internals Course Project

I developed a fully functioning databse engine from scratch across the semester through multiple milesontes.

Milestone 1: Focused on storing records in a HeapFile.
Milestone 2: Focused on storing records in a SortedFile.
Milestone 3: Focused on implementing relational operations.
Milestone 4: Query parsing, planning and connecting all the components.

Final Demo: This was project heavy course (90% of the weightage for this project and 10% for the weekly quizes). For the final exam/demo, the students were challenged to run their DB engine on a sample TPC-H dataset and queries to measure for accuracy and performance.
