Course-Projects
===============

This Repository contains a bunch of course projects that i have carried out in the grad school (UF).
Each arcive is a project that may contain the project description, source code, documentation, demo videos, report and presentation. This reporitory also contains some of the presentations & reports that i have prepared for some of the courses.
I tried to make the code readable as much as possible by adding comments and indentations. Contact me @ lakshmananvelusamy@gmail.com if you have need any clarifications regarding any of these projects.
